# üìä Hypothesis Testing on Taxi Driver Revenue
### **Analysis of Payment Type vs Total Fare Amount**

---

## ‚úÖ 1. Project Overview
The global taxi booking industry relies heavily on optimized revenue strategies to ensure both profitability and driver satisfaction.  
This data-driven project investigates whether the **method of payment (Credit Card vs Cash)** has a statistically significant impact on **total fare amount**, using hypothesis testing and exploratory data analysis.

The entire analysis is implemented using **Python on Google Colab**, supported with visualizations and descriptive statistics.

---

## ‚úÖ 2. Problem Statement
Taxi platforms offer multiple payment modes, but do all payment types generate the same revenue?

> **Is there a difference in fare amounts between credit card users and cash users?**  
If so, can taxi companies encourage certain payment methods to improve driver revenue without affecting customer experience?

---

## ‚úÖ 3. Objective
- To perform an **A/B Statistical Hypothesis Test**  
- Compare total fare between:
  - **Group A:** Credit Card payments  
  - **Group B:** Cash payments  
- Use Python-based statistical methods to test significance
- Derive revenue-focused insights from the results

---

## ‚úÖ 4. Research Question
> **Does payment type influence the total fare amount?**  
And can drivers/platforms strategically nudge customers toward higher-revenue payment methods?

---

## ‚úÖ 5. Hypothesis
- **H‚ÇÄ (Null Hypothesis):** Payment method has no significant effect on total fare amount.  
- **H‚ÇÅ (Alternative Hypothesis):** Payment method has a significant effect on total fare amount.

## ‚úÖ 6. Methodology
‚úî Dataset imported into Google Colab  
‚úî Data cleaning (handling missing values, duplicates, incorrect formats)  
‚úî Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Fare distribution
- Payment type trends
- Revenue comparison using visualizations  
‚úî Statistical Testing using Python:
- t-test / ANOVA (based on distribution and sample size)
- p-value interpretation
‚úî Business insights based on results

## ‚úÖ 8. Key Findings 
- Average fare for credit card transactions was higher than cash
- p-value < 0.05 ‚Üí **Null hypothesis rejected**
‚úÖ Payment method has a statistically significant effect on fare  
‚úÖ Card-based payments generate higher revenue on average

## ‚úÖ 9. Business Insights
- Drivers/platforms can encourage digital payments
- Cashback or loyalty points may increase card usage
- Higher transparency and reduced bargaining in card transactions
- Supports data-driven revenue optimization

## ‚úÖ 11. How to Run This Project
1. Download the notebook or open in Google Colab  
2. Install required Python libraries:
```python

## ‚úÖ 12. Conclusion

Statistical hypothesis testing shows that payment method significantly affects fare amount.
This supports decision-making for taxi drivers and companies to promote payment modes that maximize revenue and improve financial outcomes.
