Project Overview\n","The global taxi booking industry relies heavily on optimized revenue strategies to ensure both profitability and driver satisfaction.  \n","This data-driven project investigates whether the **method of payment (Credit Card vs Cash)** has a statistically significant impact on **total fare amount**, using hypothesis testing and exploratory data analysis.\n","\n","The entire analysis is implemented using **Python on Google Colab**, supported with visualizations and descriptive statistics.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## ‚úÖ 2. Problem Statement\n","Taxi platforms offer multiple payment modes, but do all payment types generate the same revenue?\n","\n","> **Is there a difference in fare amounts between credit card users and cash users?**  \n","If so, can taxi companies encourage certain payment methods to improve driver revenue without affecting customer experience?\n","\n","---\n","\n","## ‚úÖ 3. Objective\n","- To perform an **A/B Statistical Hypothesis Test**  \n","- Compare total fare between:\n","  - **Group A:** Credit Card payments  \n","  - **Group B:** Cash payments  \n","- Use Python-based statistical methods to test significance\n","- Derive revenue-focused insights from the results\n","\n","---\n","\n","## ‚úÖ 4. Research Question\n","> **Does payment type influence the total fare amount?**  \n","And can drivers/platforms strategically nudge customers toward higher-revenue payment methods?\n","\n","---\n","\n","## ‚úÖ 5. Hypothesis\n","- **H‚ÇÄ (Null Hypothesis):** Payment method has no significant effect on total fare amount.  \n","- **H‚ÇÅ (Alternative Hypothesis):** Payment method has a significant effect on total fare amount.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## ‚úÖ 6. Methodology\n","‚úî Dataset imported into Google Colab  \n","‚úî Data cleaning (handling missing values, duplicates, incorrect formats)  \n","‚úî Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):\n","- Fare distribution\n","- Payment type trends\n","- Revenue comparison using visualizations  \n","‚úî Statistical Testing using Python:\n","- t-test / ANOVA (based on distribution and sample size)\n","- p-value interpretation\n","‚úî Business insights based on results\n","\n","---\n","\n","## ‚úÖ 7. Tools & Technologies\n","| Category | Tools |\n","|----------|-------|\n","| Programming | Python (Google Colab) |\n","| Libraries | Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy |\n","| Documentation | README, PowerPoint Presentation |\n","\n","---\n","\n","## ‚úÖ 8. Key Findings\n","- Average fare for credit card transactions was higher than cash\n","- p-value < 0.05 ‚Üí **Null hypothesis rejected**\n","‚úÖ Payment method has a statistically significant effect on fare  \n","‚úÖ Card-based payments generate higher revenue on average\n","---\n","\n","## ‚úÖ 9. Business Insights\n","- Drivers/platforms can encourage digital payments\n","- Cashback or loyalty points may increase card usage\n","- Higher transparency and reduced bargaining in card transactions\n","- Supports data-driven revenue optimization\n","\n","---\n","\n","## ‚úÖ 10. Repository Structure\n","| File Name | Description |\n","|-----------|-------------|\n","| `notebook.ipynb` | Google Colab notebook with full analysis |\n","| `presentation.pptx` | Final project slides |\n","| `README.md` | Project documentation |\n","\n","---\n","\n","## ‚úÖ 11. How to Run This Project\n","1. Download the notebook or open in Google Colab  \n","2. Install required Python libraries:\n","```python\n","pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scipy\n","\n","‚úÖ 12. Conclusion\n","\n","Statistical hypothesis testing shows that payment method significantly affects fare amount.\n","This supports decision-making for taxi drivers and companies to promote payment modes that maximize revenue and improve financial outcomes.\n","\n","‚úÖ 14.
